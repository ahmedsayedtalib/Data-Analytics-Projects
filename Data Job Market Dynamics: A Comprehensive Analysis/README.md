Data Jobs Market Analysis

Data Jobs Market Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the job market for data-related 
roles using a dataset **obtained from Hugging Face ([Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets))**. The dataset consists of over 780,000
 rows and 19 columns, providing extensive insights into salary trends, 
job demand, required skills, and geographic distributions.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we extract 
meaningful patterns from the data to uncover hiring trends, salary 
distributions, and skill requirements.

📊 Key Questions Explored

💰 Salary Analysis
1- What is the salary distribution for different roles?
2- What is the difference in salaries between remote and on-site jobs?
3- Which countries/states offer the highest salaries for data professionals?
4- Do salaries differ based on the job posting platform (LinkedIn vs. Glassdoor)?

📈 Job Market Trends
5- Which companies hire the most data professionals?
6- Are certain companies more inclined towards remote hiring?
7- What is the distribution of job types (full-time, part-time, contract, internship)?
8- Which platforms are the most popular for job postings?

📌 In-Demand Skills
9- What are the most commonly required skills in job postings (Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, etc.)?
10- Do different job roles demand distinct skill sets (e.g., financial analysts vs. marketing analysts)?
11- Which skills are becoming increasingly in demand over time?
12- What percentage of jobs require programming knowledge?
13- Are there common skill combinations that appear frequently in job descriptions?

🌎 Location Insights
14- Which countries or states have the highest number of job openings?
15- How does the job market compare between the US, Europe, and Asia?
16- Which country offer the most remote job opportunities?
17- Do companies in different regions require different skill sets?

🎓 Education & Certification
18- What percentage of jobs require a university degree?
19- Do jobs that do not require a degree offer lower salaries?
20- Do certification requirements vary by company size or industry?

🔍 Insights & Findings

💰 Salary Insights
Data Scientists tend to have the highest median salaries, followed by BI Analysts and Data Analysts.
Remote jobs offer slightly higher salaries on average than on-site jobs.
The highest paying states/countries include California, New York, Switzerland, and the UK.
Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon offer some of the highest salaries in data roles.

📈 Job Market Trends
The demand for data jobs is steadily increasing, particularly for roles related to AI & ML.
Remote job listings have surged post-COVID-19, making up nearly 40% of total job postings.
LinkedIn and Glassdoor remain the top platforms for data job listings.

📌 Skills Insights
SQL and Python are the most frequently mentioned skills in job postings.
Machine Learning and AI-related skills have seen increased demand in recent years.
Tableau and Power BI are commonly requested for data visualization roles.
Data Engineering skills (ETL, Spark, Kafka) are increasingly in demand.

🌎 Location-Based Trends
The US leads in data job postings, followed by the UK, Canada, and Germany.
San Francisco, New York, and London have the highest number of job openings.
