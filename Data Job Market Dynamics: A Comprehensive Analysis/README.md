**Data Jobs Market Analysis**


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the job market for data-related roles using a dataset obtained from Hugging Face (Hugging Face Datasets). The dataset consists of over 780,000 rows and 19 columns, providing extensive insights into salary trends, job demand, required skills, and geographic distributions.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we extract meaningful patterns from the data to uncover hiring trends, salary distributions, and skill requirements.
📊 Key Questions Explored

    What is the difference in salaries between remote and on-site jobs?
    Which countries/states offer the highest salaries for data professionals?
    Do salaries differ based on the job posting platform (LinkedIn vs. Glassdoor)?

📈 Job Market Trends

    Which companies hire the most data professionals?
    Are certain companies more inclined towards remote hiring?
    What is the distribution of job types (full-time, part-time, contract, internship)?
